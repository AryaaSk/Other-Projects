## Allergy Menu
This project has 2 websites:
One for restaurants to add their current menu with their food's allergies and descriptions
Other one for customers to input their allergies and can see what food they can eat in the restaurant

Finished the basic concept, there are still a few issues but they are more visual and productivity related rather can the core concept, such as adding sections to the menu, changing the colours and adding specific allergies to each restaurant.

Here is the customer website: https://allergycheckercustomer.azurewebsites.net, below is a sample photo of the customer site:

Front-end is built with Angular, but backend API is built in Python with Firebase for the authentication and database. Used Azure to host the website and the API.

## Colour Game
A game where you have to try and get all the colours in the correct order, it shows you your previous moves and you have to use trial and error to get the correct order.

Here is the URL: https://colours.azurewebsites.net

Correct means the colour is in the correct position, almost means it is 1 within the correct position
