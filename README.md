## Allergy Menu
This project has 2 websites:
One for restaurants to add their current menu with their food's allergies and descriptions
Other one for customers to input their allergies and can see what food they can eat in the restaurant

Finished the basic concept, there are still a few issues but they are more visual and productivity related rather can the core concept, such as adding sections to the menu, changing the colours and adding specific allergies to each restaurant.

Here is the customer website: https://allergycheckercustomer.azurewebsites.net, below is a sample photo of the customer site:

Front-end is built with Angular, but backend API is built in Python with Firebase for the authentication and database. Used Azure to host the website and the API.

## Colour Game
A game where you have to try and get all the colours in the correct order, it shows you your previous moves and you have to use trial and error to get the correct order.

Here is the URL: https://colours.azurewebsites.net

Here are some previews:

Correct means the colour is in the correct position, almost means it is 1 within the correct position

## Connect4 Embeded
This is part of a bigger project but for now I'll just show the embeded site, basically it just gives you a connect4 game which you can embed into your websites, I have added it to my Web Operating System as an app, without having to write any game code inside that project.

Use this URL to access the embed mode: https://connect4-863d1.web.app/game.html?embed=true

The minimum width and height is: 740px X 1000px
If this is too large or too small for you, you can also add an optional scale parameter, 0.5 will apply a 50% scale, 2 will apply a 200% scale.
Here is an example of a URL with scale: https://connect4-863d1.web.app/game.html?embed=true&&scale=0.5

Here is an example to just add to your HTML:
```
<iframe  style="height: 1000px; width: 740px" src="https://connect4-863d1.web.app/game.html?embed=true&&scale=1"></iframe>
```
